# ðŸŽ¯ Oil Production Analysis  

This project applies spatial analytics and geostatistical modeling to improve oil well placement and production strategy. By leveraging geological survey data and kriging interpolation, we identified high-potential drilling zones to support data-driven decision-making in oil exploration.
This analysis was conducted as part of the DSO 545: Statistical Computing and Data Visualization course at the University of Southern California.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

Oil field exploration involves complex geological variables such as porosity, depth, and pressure. This project used spatial modeling and statistical computing techniques to predict porosity in unsampled locations and recommend efficient drilling zones.

We started with a cleaned dataset containing geological features across hundreds of well sites. The core steps of the project included:

- Preprocessing production and geostatistics data  
- Modeling spatial dependence using variograms  
- Applying **Ordinary Kriging** to estimate porosity across the field  
- Visualizing potential drilling zones using contour maps and 3D surface plots  
- Interpreting spatial patterns to support well planning decisions

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Predict porosity values in regions where no well data exists  
- Uncover spatial trends in subsurface geology  
- Recommend drilling locations that maximize production potential  
- Reduce exploration risk and improve planning with data visualization
